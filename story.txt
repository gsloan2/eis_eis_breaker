Our group decided to go to Berlin.
We drove a BMW to get Gebaeck.
After he ate all the gebaecks, all he wanted to do is sit in front of the klimaanlage.
So we couldn't get any gebaecks because of him, the lead singer of Rammstein, the Lindemann.
We took our Hund to the Biergarten for some Bratwurst.
In our way we saw a bakery, there was an amazing apple cake smell
I wish they had more klimaanlage because it's so hot.
We flipped a 180 and almost took out several women in dirndels.
Meanwhile, Mehlhase was being wettbewerbsfaehig driving her Porsche on the Hauptstasse.
"It's on like Donkey Kong" exclaimed the treiber, turning up the speakers to max and blasting Rammstein.
With the peddle to the metal Mehlhase was on her way to Raesfeld
We started going so fast, my head was spinning, wondering if I'll need a blood Doener by the end.git add story
As we began to speed up we started catching up to Mehlase. We saw the Flughafen quickly approaching in the distance
